The codes used for fitting of the modeled auroral images to the ones observed with Auroral Structure and Kinetics (ASK) instrument.
The method uses the convoluted 3D electron emission model with ion drift velocity as the free parameter, for which we solve using 
the Chi-Square (χ2) statistics. Code is written in MatLab and the “main.m” code has step-by-step explanation of the process. Since 
the modeling is quite complex, the method is divided into multiple steps and in total it takes around 30 hours to fully analyse the 
auroral event.
